# storefront
A CLI storefront app with MySQL databasing

This app is a mysql database-driven storefront app written in javascript for Node/Express. When the app is launched, it presents a live list of products in the system and allows you to purchase by selecting an item. If the quanitity is available, the purchase goes through. If not, an error message is displayed. Pretty strait forward.

Below is a link to a video showing basic functionality:
